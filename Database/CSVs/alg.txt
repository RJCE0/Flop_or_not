1. Find a player P
2. Find their club C, and the year Y
3. Get all of the stats of the Starting 11 for C in the year (Y - 1)
    You should now have player P's stats in the year Y alongside the starting
    11 for C in the year (Y - 1). Player P should be playing for C in the year
    Y.
4. Organise that into 1 row in with a fixed length (NN has fixed input)
5. From here we can do other things (PCA, Removing rows w mcl, scalling etc)

Notes:
- Ideally we would choose all players on a team, but we have to choose a fixed 
number of players because of the NNs fixed input size
- If a player only exists in 1 year Y and not in another year Y-1, they will 
have to be removed from the dataset.


---CEO COMMENTS---

- use list and year -1 can be found from indexing, only using years 2022-23 -> 2019-20 because out of bound error on Y-1 for 2018-19
- ORDER BY mins 
- select from club
- Take top 15 players + himself for y-1, excluding gk
- Run for each player per club
